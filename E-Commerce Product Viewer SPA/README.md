# Overview

The app simulates a small online clothing store. Users can:

* Browse a catalog of products
* Filter and sort items in multiple ways
* View detailed information for a single product
* Add items to a shopping cart
* See a running summary of cart totals, shipping, and tax
* Come back later and see their cart still saved
* Everything runs on the client using JS. Product data and cart state are stored in localStorage so they persist between visits.

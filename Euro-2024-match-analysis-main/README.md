Group Members: Zain, Duy, and Nanden

This project provides a comprehensive visual dashboard for analyzing a Euro 2024 football match between Germany and Spain. It allows users to track and visualize match statistics, including xG (expected goals), possession data, and shot maps for both teams, offering insights into the performance of a game.

## Features
- **xG Flow Charts**: Displays the flow of expected goals for teams over time during a match.
- **Possession Charts**: Visualizes the percentage of possession each team had throughout the game.
- **Shot Maps**: Plots the location of shots taken by each team during the match, providing a clear view of offensive performance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Built using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, making the plots dynamic and customizable.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for data processing and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient handling and manipulation of match data.
- **Matplotlib**: To generate detailed visualizations such as shot maps, xG charts, and possession charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For combining code, visuals, and analysis in one interactive environment.
